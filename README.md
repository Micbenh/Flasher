# A little about Flasher

![](images/pic.PNG)

Flasher is my first project that i built on my own and not a tutorial-follow project :)

in total it mixes the following skills i have learned and wanted to practice:
1) Web Scraping - using Beautiful soup in order to collect 150 flash game links that are generated randomly by the button click

2) web programming - Writing basic Flask actions that i have learned

3) html, css, and css-grid - learn the basics of html, general design with css and layout wit css-grid 

4) python - a mix of everything above and being able to configure everything together and packages it as an application

5) git - first time using git on my own and first time pushing to github and opening a repository

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.6+
* pip install -r requirements.txt
